## Cognitive Maps
A cognitive map, introduced by Edward Tolman in 1948, is a type of mental representation associated with the representation and navigation of physical space. 
The concept of a cognitive map is more generally concerned with how experience is organized to form knowledge, underlying the organization of conceptual and social spaces.
