## What is **Neurorobotics**?
#### Neurorobotics is the combined study of **Neuroscience, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence**.
It is the science and technology of **Embodied Autonomous Neural Systems**.
- **Embodied** means that you have a body together with a brain, 
- **Autonomous** means that the system can move in an environment, it can interact with an environment and
- **Neural** means that the agent is controlled by some sort of a brain that is a system **inspired** or even **directly modeled** after an animal brain.
#### The goal behind in development of the new robotics platform is to replicate, validate, and train brain models.
